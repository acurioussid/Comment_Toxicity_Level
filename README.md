# Comment_Toxicity_Level
Built a Deep learning model which can classify any text message based on its toxicity level. 

# Process
- Preprocessing the dataset using various techniques such as text vectorization in Keras, caching, shuffling, batching, and prefetching to ensure optimal performance and accuracy.
- Creating a Sequential model using Bi-directional LSTM and Dense layers to classify text messages based on its toxicity level.
- Evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics such as categorical accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and varying the hyperparameters in the Sequential model to optimize the model's performance.
- Creating a basic UI using Gradio to enable users to input a text message and receive an instant classification of its toxicity level.
